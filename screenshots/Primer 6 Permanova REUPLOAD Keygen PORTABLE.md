# How to Perform Permanova Analysis with Primer 6
 
Permanova, or permutational multivariate analysis of variance, is a statistical method that can be used to test the differences among groups of samples based on their multivariate composition. Permanova is especially useful for ecological data, where the samples are often characterized by many variables (such as species abundance or environmental factors) and the groups are defined by some factor of interest (such as treatment, location, or time).

One of the software tools that can perform Permanova analysis is Primer 6, a package designed for analyzing ecological data. Primer 6 has a user-friendly interface and a variety of graphical outputs that can help you interpret the results of your Permanova test. However, Primer 6 is not free and requires a license to use. If you have purchased Primer 6 but lost your installation file or license key, you may need to reupload the software from the official website.
 
In this article, we will show you how to perform Permanova analysis with Primer 6 and how to reupload the software if you need to. We will assume that you have already installed Primer 6 on your computer and have some data ready to analyze.
 
## Step 1: Prepare your data
 
The first step is to prepare your data for Permanova analysis. You will need two files: one containing the multivariate data matrix (such as species abundance or environmental variables) and one containing the grouping factor (such as treatment, location, or time). The multivariate data matrix should have rows corresponding to samples and columns corresponding to variables. The grouping factor file should have one column with the sample names and another column with the group labels. The sample names should match exactly between the two files.
 
For example, suppose you have a dataset of fish abundance in four different sites (A, B, C, and D) sampled at three different times (1, 2, and 3). Your multivariate data matrix file could look something like this:
  | Sample | Species 1 | Species 2 | Species 3 | Species 4 | |--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | A1     | 10        | 5         | 3         | 2         | | A2     | 12        | 4         | 2         | 1         | | A3     | 11        | 6         | 4         | 3         | | B1     | 8         | 7         | 5         | 4         | | B2     | 9         | 8         | 6         | 5         | | B3     | 7         | 9         | 7         | 6         | | C1     | 5         | 10        | 8         | 7         | | C2     | 4         | 11        | 9         | 8         | | C3     | 6         | 12        | 10        | 9         | | D1     | 3         | 8         | 11        | 10        | | D2     | 2         | 9         | 12        | 11        | | D3     | 4         | 10        | 13        | 12        |  
Your grouping factor file could look something like this:
  | Sample  	| Site  	| |---------	|------	| | A1      	| A    	| | A2      	| A    	| | A3      	| A    	| | B1      	| B    	| | B2      	| B    	| | B3      	| B    	| | C1      	| C    	| | C2      	| C    	| | C3      	| C    	| | D1      	| D    	| | D2      	| D    	| | D3      	| D    	|  
You can save these files as Excel or CSV formats and name them as you wish. For this example, we will name them as "fish\_data.csv" and "fish\_site.csv".
