- It is not guaranteed to recover all your data. Some data may be overwritten or corrupted beyond recovery. The success rate of the recovery depends on many factors, such as the condition of your disk, the type of your files, and the time elapsed since the deletion.
- It may take a long time to scan and recover your data. Depending on the size and complexity of your disk or device, the scanning and recovery process may take hours or even days to complete.
- It may pose some security risks. Since you have to download the software from a third-party website and connect your wallet to make the purchase, you may expose your personal information and funds to hackers or scammers. You should always be careful and verify the authenticity and reputation of the website and the seller before making any transactions.

Tanin Tlo is not a substitute for regular backups. You should always backup your data regularly and store it in a safe place. Tanin Tlo is only a last resort option when you have no other way to recover your data.
